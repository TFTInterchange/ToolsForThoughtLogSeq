- [[Meeting Notes]] [[Frode Hegland]] [[Boris Mann]]
	- Make a Tools for Thought [[Awesome List]]?
		- Found this very small list by just one person, last updated [[Feb 23rd, 2020]] https://github.com/jamesonl/awesome-tools-for-thought
		- Last updated [[June 10th, 2020]], an awesome [[Roam Research]] list https://github.com/roam-unofficial/awesome-roam
	- Boris' goals with Tools for Thought Interchange
		- Convene a volunteer run community of interest around Tools for Thought
		- Run an ongoing speaker series
		- Collaborate on creating code and specs/formats
	- Cross over with [[Future of Text]]?
		- Doesn't want to include things around e.g. images or graphs necessarily
		- Definitely good energy and interest between the two, could get [[Howard Rheingold]] or [[Vint Cerf]] to be part of speaker series in the future
		- Open invitation -- want people to be part of Volume 2 of the book
		- Join the [[Circle]] powered community if interested https://future-of-text.circle.so/c/welcome
	- How does Frode think about the cross over between the two?
		- TFT is action oriented and has some level of code / tech "we build stuff"
		- Frode as tool maker, definer of [[Visual Meta]] format for interchange, and [[Augmented Text Company]] creator of [[Augmented Text Reader]] and [[Augmented Text Author]]
		- For TFT, ask everyone: what is your plan for interchange?
		- Frode interested in copy paste / clipboard buffer interoperability -- desktop apps and beyond?
		- Boris quote: "There are no islands -- WTF is your plan?"
		- TODO Boris write up notes
		- TODO Frodo post about how to discuss long form via PDF documents
