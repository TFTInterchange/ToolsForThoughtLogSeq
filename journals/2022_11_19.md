- Logging [[Peter Kaminski]]'s thoughts on [[Nov 17th, 2022]] for an open question: [[How long can the TFTRocks Mastodon server be relied upon?]]
- There is a [[Colophon]] page for this site [[TFTRocks Notes]], but let's start a [[Community Infrastructure]] page
- [[Michael Gartner]] contributed another #PR - [Monthly Meetings and a START HERE page](https://github.com/ToolsForThoughtRocks/ToolsForThoughtLogSeq/pull/5)
- There's a `logseq/bak` folder that ended up not being added to git
	- [[Can I delete the contents within the "bak" folder]] is covered on the #LogSeq forum
	- Adding a rule to gitignore -- these files will still be synced in the Dropbox copy
- Discussion with [[Yoyogi]] author on using it for front end experimentation
