- The meta list that aggregates other awesome lists is here https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
- The [Awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) describes how / why to run a list
	- **Comment on why something is awesome**
	  Apart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers why it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.
	- **Make it clear what the list is about**
	  Have a succinct description at the top of your readme. Make sure your list covers a certain scope and nothing else. Link to other awesome lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.
	- Pay attention to grammar
	  Ensure your list is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors. This should also apply to pull requests.
	- Choose an appropriate license
	  Keep in mind that if you haven't selected a license, it basically means the people are not allowed to reproduce, distribute or create derivative works.
	- Creative Commons licenses are perfect for this purpose. We would recommend CC0. Code licenses like MIT, BSD, GPL, and so forth are not recommended.
	- Include contribution guidelines
	  People who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.
	- If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our contributing.md and modify it to your own needs.
	- Stylize your list properly
	  Create a table of contents, organize the content into different categories, and use images if suitable. Ensure all entries are consistent (e.g. all entry descriptions end in a .).
	- Accept other people's opinion
	  If you're an owner of the list, respect other people's opinion. If there are plenty of users not agreeing to your decision, give it a second thought.
