- The July meeting featured three tool makers. Thanks to everyone for attending the talk, and for our three speakers for presenting.
- The recording ended up over 1.5 hours, and we chatted a little off the record too. Lesson learned: leave some buffer time to spend more time hanging out with TfT people!
- The video is on the event page and also on our new YouTube channel https://youtu.be/u-ib5IZnZu0
