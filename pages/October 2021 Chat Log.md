  00:17:24	Rosano:	tools for thoughting for tools for thought
  00:19:10	Eric Burns:	The tools enable the workflow.  The workflow is what's important.  :o)
  00:21:22	Eric Burns:	(though I will admit, some tools make new workflows possible)
  00:21:26	Rosano:	https://rosano.ca/wetware
  00:21:39	Jess Martin:	yay for a URL to the presentation notes!
  00:24:29	Jess Martin:	rosano is async
  00:25:05	Bill Seitz:	my flows http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/MyDigitalGardeningProcess
  00:25:18	Joe Trellick:	Queueing things by default üíØ
  00:26:03	Jess Martin:	1000% reading on an ereader
  00:27:51	Joe Trellick:	Aggressive email filtering of newsletters and all other robot traffic into a separate folder that I only check at specific times has been a big life improvement this year
  00:28:42	Eric Burns:	I like how you tag by "when will I want this" - your way of putting it where you're likely to encounter it.
  00:31:16	Jess Martin:	ah, here's joybox
  00:31:17	Jess Martin:	https://github.com/joyboxapp/joybox
  00:33:13	Miguel Marcos Martinez:	Kommit:   https://awesomeopensource.com/project/kommitapp/kommit?categoryPage=41
  00:35:40	Eric Burns:	Interesting ‚Ä¶ so, joybox is for when *you* determine you want to learn something ‚Ä¶ and kommit intrudes upon you to remind you to rehearse something....
  00:35:51	Eric Burns:	(Intrudes in an intentional way)
  00:41:13	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Curious: schema language?
  00:46:25	Bill Seitz:	I‚Äôve pondered embedding YAML block at top-or-bottom of Markdown box, feeding some NoSql.
  00:46:40	Jess Martin:	@map gave a "sorta" wavey hand
  00:49:18	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Datalog: It's clearly a strong paradigm, but i do not think it covers all the cases
  00:49:52	Boris Mann:	@map that‚Äôs my bombastic statement of end user adoption
  00:50:15	Joe Trellick:	https://hyperdraft.rosano.ca/
  00:52:24	Bill Seitz:	what‚Äôs the stack?

  00:56:26	Bill Seitz:	http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/IntermediatePacket
  00:57:28	Bill Seitz:	Weather Report from the 80s?
  00:58:05	Jess Martin:	"I don't spend a lot of time app-ing."
  00:58:25	Jess Martin:	definitely stealing that term!
  00:58:32	Rosano:	opencollective.com/rosano
  00:58:36	Miguel Marcos Martinez:	Weather Report from the 70s and 80s.
  00:58:40	Rosano:	https://opencollective.com/rosano
  00:58:50	Miguel Marcos Martinez:	Awesome, Rosano.
  00:59:28	Eric Burns:	This was very thought-provoking, Rosano.  Thank you.
  01:02:16	Angelo:	https://remotestorage.io/
  01:02:37	Jess Martin:	same feeling about pocket... it's not bad enough to replace
  01:02:53	Jess Martin:	I've had to bolt things around it
  01:05:16	Miguel Marcos Martinez:	That‚Äôs how Scrivener works.
  01:05:21	Rosano:	The Memex Method https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46
  01:05:24	Jess Martin:	Eric: couldn't hear you
  01:06:52	Jess Martin:	Linus Lee's Monocle!
  01:09:45	Bill Seitz:	http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/PESOS
  01:09:55	Jess Martin:	ty @bill!
  01:10:48	Jess Martin:	Linus built twttr
  01:10:53	Jess Martin:	his own twitter client, ofc
  01:11:08	Marc-Antoine Parent:	OTH in the native apps, you‚Äôre not sure you can export. Exporting from facebook, for example, is a nightmare.
  01:11:48	Jess Martin:	@map I see you :)
  01:12:02	Angelo:	there was a ‚Äúweb 2.0‚Äù app some time ago called ‚Äústreamly‚Äù that ingested a bunch of different data sources - but they disappeared because no one was willing to pay for it.
  01:12:14	Jess Martin:	first public talk I gave was about mashups
  01:12:32	Bill Seitz:	http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/MashUp
  01:12:55	Jess Martin:	https://github.com/thesephist/lucerne/
  01:13:08	Jess Martin:	Linus's twitter client ^
  01:14:45	Jess Martin:	https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1452438176996347907
  01:14:52	Rosano:	great thread!
  01:14:54	Jess Martin:	"export considered harmful" thread ^
  01:17:01	Marc-Antoine Parent:	From the mashup era, I remember all the visual programming tools like yahoo pipes‚Ä¶ adoption was not brilliant, alas.
  01:17:20	Jess Martin:	@map I built some stuff on Pipes!
  01:17:56	Marc-Antoine Parent:	And then it broke‚Ä¶ there is a specific profile for us early adopters of such tools.
  01:18:22	Doug:	FWIW, the Palm LifeDrive was named for it‚Äôs ability to store every memo you would ever write.
  01:18:41	Bill Seitz:	http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/LifeStreaming
  01:18:43	Angelo:	remote storage is a really great tool that allows for hosting individual content on your own, but also allowing others to utilize your storage server if you want. and if you dont want to run your own there are 3rd party offerings as well.
  01:19:09	Rosano:	@angelo i think that's a great way to make data extensible and interoperable, i start there
  01:19:43	Jess Martin:	he wrote it in Ink!!
  01:19:44	Jess Martin:	hhaahah
  01:19:48	Jess Martin:	his own programming language
  01:20:05	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Hofstadter had a column where he once was telling people how to write lisp, and a worked exercise was to take a book, say Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses, as a list, and return a list with the first and last word. The reverse function (re-Joyce) was left as an exercise to the reader.
  01:21:28	Marc-Antoine Parent:	AND all the cases in between public and private. And move things between categories.
  01:22:33	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Encrypt
  01:22:59	Marc-Antoine Parent:	(Which means delayed publication ;-)
  01:23:42	Jess Martin:	ah.. LANs...
  01:23:47	Jess Martin:	"situated software"
  01:24:01	Jess Martin:	You hardly need auth - if you're on the LAN, you can get in
  01:24:04	Bill Seitz:	http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SituatedSoftware
  01:24:11	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Encryption at file or pipe level, really
  01:24:37	Jess Martin:	@bill love these links to your personal wiki!
  01:24:53	Bill Seitz:	20yrs ‚Üí 20k pages
  01:26:59	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Moving the complexity to the federation level ;-)  (as appropriate tbh)
  01:27:37	Eric Burns:	That's interesting ‚Ä¶ we usually put value on reuse.  But perhaps if SW becomes much easier to create ‚Ä¶ there's not really a need to reuse things....
  01:28:08	Eric Burns:	So, like ‚Ä¶ I don't repair my socks.  Getting new socks is much simpler.
  01:28:38	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Works if you detach data from software, as we said before.
  01:29:33	Jess Martin:	@map: great point wins - I'm also learning about that
  01:29:58	Jess Martin:	Best Fork wins! If it's easy to _rebuild_, you just build a new one, that combines those different forks' features.
  01:30:11	Marc-Antoine Parent:	This is why being able to do ACLs on data fragments is so important‚Ä¶ fission is definitely leading here.
  01:30:13	Jess Martin:	(I realize I'm living in a dreamed-of future right now)
  01:30:50	Bill Seitz:	Replit is interesting. Bring up your own dev environment, run it.
