- 00:29:04	Boris Mann:	Are things like calendars / calendar events a first class type?
- 00:34:07	Jess Martin:	ohhhh I love this - I've wanted to build a customizable "home page" for myself for a while
- 00:34:13	Bill Seitz:	What can I do on my phone?
- 00:34:32	Boris Mann:	@bill Electron only today I believe
- 00:34:42	Jack Park:	Wow!
- 00:36:51	Jack Park:	https://github.com/unigraph-dev
- 00:37:14	Jess Martin:	Reminds me of Rosano's home-grown queueing systems he set up for the
- different "intakes" he has: podcasts, yt videos, tweets, etc
- 00:38:08	Jess Martin:	WOOO edit the app inside the app!
- 00:41:58	Jess Martin:	oh dang, that's nice

- 00:50:59	Jess Martin:	distributed graph not just a distributed system question, also a major UX question!
- 00:51:09	Jess Martin:	public/private space, etc
- 00:54:23	Jess Martin:	feels more like a replacement for the operating system than a tool for thought... as a good TFT should :)
- 00:55:21	Boris Mann:	Power tools add on. Alfred. etc.
- 00:58:17	Christopher Galtenberg:	The "social emotional" line was so good, I'm going to have to transcribe that for myself üòÑ
- 00:59:10	Kushan :	How are you planning to keep things from outside in sync ? For example , I delete a tweet after I have pulled it in to unigraph
- 00:59:31	@chadkoh:	Can/will we be able to open multiple windows/tabs simultaneously?
- 01:03:45	Boris Mann:	I can imagine pointing this at a collection of markdown files
- 01:04:03	Boris Mann:	Everything is a sync problem üôÇ
- 01:04:05	Jess Martin:	‚òùÔ∏è this
- 01:04:07	Boris Mann:	Or a search problem.
- 01:06:08	Tanner Seidman:	I wonder how difficult it would be to make a plugin for the different methods, like org-roam or logseq
- 01:06:14	Tudor Girba:	thank you! great work!
- 01:06:16	Tanner Seidman:	Thanks!
- 01:06:19	Jack Park:	Thanks Sophia!
- 01:06:31	Boris Mann:	Sync: depends on the API in part
- 01:06:46	@chadkoh:	Great job Sophia üëè üëè üëè
- 01:07:00	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Very impressive!
- 01:07:28	Michael Gartner:	Ctrl-A
- 01:07:34	Michael Gartner:	maybe
- 01:07:51	Michael Gartner:	nevermind
- 01:16:02	Jess Martin:	the similarities between GToolkit and Unigraph, at least in spirit, are fascinating... amazing watching these two back-to-back

  01:23:11	Bill Seitz:	fix your thoughts in production
  01:23:30	Jess Martin:	think by coding
  01:24:26	Jess Martin:	he could make it scroll pixel by pixel instead of line-by-line ;)

  01:25:44	Boris Mann:	I should just have a redirect where if my system doesn‚Äôt have a slug, it just goes to Bill‚Äôs site!
  01:26:05	Jess Martin:	that's an amazing idea
  01:26:07	Rob Haisfield:	Tudor, would you please explain the difference between implicit and explicit references?
  01:26:51	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Just downloaded, thank you! Awesome work.
  01:27:02	Sophia Xu:	^ is it like Roam where it‚Äôs linked vs unlinked references
  01:27:12	Jess Martin:	workflow > tools
  01:27:33	Jess Martin:	also, mediums > tools - when you say "kinds of thoughts", it sounds like you're referring to different mediums
  01:27:41	Orion Reed:	This ^
  01:28:04	Jess Martin:	I wrote about this a bit last week: https://jessmart.in/articles/tools
  01:28:37	Jess Martin:	+100000 to diff views of same object
  01:30:54	Bill Seitz:	in most languages, a ‚Äúfile‚Äù contains lots of code ‚Äúnodes‚Äù, is that also true here?
  01:32:27	Bill Seitz:	mentality kinda reminds me of Emails ‚Üí OrgMode, etc.
  01:33:15	Bill Seitz:	(‚ÄúEmails‚Äù ‚Üí Emacs)
  01:33:51	Sophia Xu:	^^
  01:34:19	Jess Martin:	again, seems like we're moving from TFT -> Operating System. Which I *love* to see. "Lepiter became the core" is super interesting.
  01:35:23	Rob Haisfield:	Newmacs
  01:36:09	Jess Martin:	The emacs / orgmode reference is apropos - seems like emacs user just default to extending emacs to support their use case rather than having to leave the "environment" they're in
  01:36:26	Jess Martin:	*users
  01:37:28	Bill Seitz:	I wonder whether we‚Äôre waiting for equivalent to be based on a Functional language‚Ä¶.
  01:38:05	Jess Martin:	@Bill can you say more about that?
  01:38:06	Rob Haisfield:	Bill can you elaborate on that? What‚Äôs the difference between this sort of thing being object oriented like Pharo-based Lepiter and functional?
  01:38:33	Bill Seitz:	I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶ just feels like Smalltalk is the Nuclear Fusion of languages/stacks.
  01:38:39	Bill Seitz:	always 20 years away
  01:38:47	Jess Martin:	programming = executable philosophy ‚ù§Ô∏è
  01:38:54	Jess Martin:	@bill hahah got it
  01:40:02	Bill Seitz:	And I feel like the Next Thing needs to be cloud-native‚Ä¶. http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/PersonalCloud
  01:40:44	Bill Seitz:	So a dumb phone can be a client.
  01:40:59	Bill Seitz:	(Actually, not Dumb, just Locked)
  01:41:00	Boris Mann:	Blogging / social media brought people to a wider discourse (For good and ill)
  01:41:10	Boris Mann:	This feels like ‚Äúcitizen programming‚Äù in a similar way
  01:41:36	Boris Mann:	TFT feels connected to blogging, but when you start programming it becomes a different thing
  01:42:24	Jess Martin:	strong agree with Bill re: cloud-native. "local-first" is a nice tag line, but it should really be "distributed-first" or something along those lines. "local-first" is often opposed to "cloud-first."
  01:43:03	Tanner Seidman:	Or ideally, for me at least- local-cloud first
  01:43:05	Jess Martin:	@boris: I think of "simulation" as the bridge between thinking and programming. If I'm not trying to engineer a production _thing_, but I'm reasoning about some ideas, I might want to use some code to simulate something about the knowledge.
  01:43:15	Boris Mann:	That‚Äôs a programmer view
  01:43:32	Jess Martin:	maybe. financial analysts take that view.
  01:43:33	Boris Mann:	I‚Äôm trying to figure out how a mass market user base begins to do these things more ‚Ä¶ or if they will
  01:43:47	Rob Haisfield:	^Jess yes. When Tudor first demoed Lepiter to me, I just thought about modeling information moreso than programming
  01:44:09	Boris Mann:	Definitely like Jupiter notebooks or whatever
  01:44:11	Bill Seitz:	Spreadsheet as gateway‚Ä¶ http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/NoCode
  01:44:15	Bill Seitz:	Yes Jupyter
  01:44:27	wesley:	@Boris, what about TfT curricula in public schools?
  01:44:27	Boris Mann:	I talked to Dylan Steck / Cortex and he‚Äôs playing with spreadsheets and financial / budget data
  01:44:43	Sophia Xu:	Gotta run but t\hank you Tudor for this amazing presentation!
  01:44:46	Boris Mann:	So all of a sudden your grocery bill and shopping lists ‚Ä¶ a very personal item ‚Ä¶ becomes programmable
  01:44:58	Boris Mann:	Thanks Sophia ‚Äî we‚Äôll get your slides and post in a week or so.
  01:45:33	Bill Seitz:	Spreadsheet as fundamental UI pattern?
  01:45:36	@chadkoh:	Thank you!
