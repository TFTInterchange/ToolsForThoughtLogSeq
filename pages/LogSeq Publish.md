- Publish your LogSeq graph with a GitHub Action. ✨
- This action is the missing piece for achieving a complete CD workflow for your public Logseq graph.
	- It will load your graph and publish it into  `www`  (this is configurable) folder.
	- Next, you can then deploy  `www`  folder with [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action).
