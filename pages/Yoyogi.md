- Yoyogi is, in simple terms, a Google Reader-inspired #ActivityPub reader app. It rejects The Timeline, where posts from lots of people are interleaved temporally. It instead elevates the author and centers the thread. You log in. You pick one account youâ€™re following. You see just their threads.
