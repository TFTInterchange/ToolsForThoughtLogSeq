- Answer by [[Ramses Oudt]]:
- > The  `bak`  folder contains backup files. These are created when there’s a conflict between the text file on disk and the page in the database—which mostly happens when using Logseq in combination with sync services like OneDrive, Dropbox, and iCloud.
  > You can safely delete the files in the  `bak`  folder, though they may come in handy if you want to roll back a file version.
