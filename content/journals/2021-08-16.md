- Oh right, I set this up before! I think [[LogSeq]] works nice for "open" notes in a shared Github repo
- Let's make an [[Event Listing]] page
	- I assume there is a way of tagging things and making a query
	- Auto generate event listing based on a query, dates, and some tagging -- past events, upcoming events, etc.
	  :LOGBOOK:
