[[Boris Mann]] hosts and admins a [[Mastodon]] server for the TFTRocks community at https://toolsforthought.social

It is open to any TFT interested people to create accounts, either by invitation from an existing member, or by [applying for an account](https://toolsforthought.social/auth/sign_up).

Contribute to the [[Tools For Thought Rocks Open Collective]] to support running the server. 

The server was originally running at the root domain here https://toolsforthought.rocks. [More info about the move](https://commonscomputer.com/t/tft-rocks-mastodon-server-move/13)
