abstract = {KMS is a commercial hypermedia system developed by Knowledge Systems for networks of heterogeneous workstations. It is designed to support organization-wide collaboration for a broad range of applications, such as electronic publishing, software engineering, project management, computer-aided design and on-line documentation. KMS is a successor to the ZOG system developed at Carnegie Mellon University from 1972 to 1985. A KMS database consists of screen-sized WYSIWYG workspaces called frames that contain text, graphics and image items. Single items in frames can be linked to other frames. They may also be used to invoke programs. The database can be distributed across an indefinite number of file servers and be as large as available disk space permits. Independently developed KMS databases can be linked together. The KMS user interface uses an extreme form of direct manipulation. A single browser/editor is used to traverse the database and manipulate its contents. Over 85% of the user’s interaction is direct—a single point-and-click designates both object and operation. Running on Sun and Apollo workstations, KMS accesses and displays frames in less than one second, on average. This paper describes KMS and how it addresses a number of hypermedia design issues.},

abstract = {Hypertextual in nature, the Web in its earliest form was technically limited and not capable of using the full richness of hypertext at that time. Despite subsequent advances in Web technology, some of the older hypertextual capabilities remain unrealised and hypertext/media appears to be treated more as a technology than a medium. For a hypertext docuverse that holds changing information, such as a knowledge base, paying heed to its hypertextual structure aids the long-term health and sustainability of the knowledge it contains. Wikipedia is the world largest public hypertext knowledge base. Constantly updated by humans and bots, it is an ever-changing knowledge store. Using Wikipedia as a context, this thesis investigates whether large collaborative hypertexts show signs of their contributors using deliberate hypertextual structure or are simply connecting ?pages? of digital content. The research also considers collaborative hypertexts in the context of social machines with regard to sustaining organisational knowledge as hypertext content. The results reveal under-use of processes available to sustain and improve an organisation?s docuverse and a gap in organisational roles and skill-sets to apply those processes.},

abstract = {Conferences such as ACM Hypertext have been running for many decades and the metadata on their collected publications represent a valuable scholarly meta-history on areas such as the community’s health, diversity, and changing interests. But the metadata about these papers is not readily available for analysis, and the data collection and cleaning tasks appear substantial. In this paper we attempt to explore this challenge using the ACM Hypertext series as a case study. Taking the ACM Digital Library as a starting point, and using a combination of manual and automatic methods, we have constructed and released a 3-star Open Dataset representing over 1000 publications by almost 2,500 authors. An initial analysis reveals a modestly-sized but robust conference, with a changing pattern of in-citations that co-occurs with the arrival of social media, and a relatively consistent but imbalanced gender ratio of authors that shows some signs of recent improvements. The challenges encountered included identifying discrete author names, potential issues with text retrieval from PDF, and a disparate set of author keywords that reveals an absence of a common vocabulary. These insights are the results of a hard-fought process that is made complex by an incomplete digital record and a lack of consistency in naming. This Hypertext case study thus reveals a serious shortfall in the way that scholarly activity is captured and described, and questions PDF as the primary method of recording publications. Addressing these issues would make further analysis more straightforward and would allow larger events (with orders of magnitude more data) to be analysed in a similar way.},

In this paper we provide a detailed description of node-link structures. We argue that Dexter does not match the need of CB-OHS, as it supports a mix of multiple structure domains. Based on the implementation of link support in our system Mother we demonstrate how Dexter needs to be tailored accordingly. We further describe Mother’s ability of node-link structures to interoperate with other available structure services and vice versa},

After discussing the ways in which plot may be varied, I describe the use of stretchtext as a reaction against the perceived incoherence of classic hypertext narrative, demonstrate the limitations that conventional stretchtext necessarily imposes on hypertext narrative, and describe an implemented generalization of stretchtext that matches the expressive and formal capabilities of classical hypertext systems while appearing to be a mere stretchtext and while running within the confines of a Web browser.},

Section 6, paras 1-2
The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.

The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.



Section 8, para 2, sentence 2:
There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.

The link models that are reviewed range from the tightly coupled links implemented by html in the World Wide Web, through to the loosely coupled links adopted by some link server systems.

The paper concludes that there can be no universal solution to this problem; rather there is a range of approaches from which hypertext developers must choose a solution appropriate to their needs.},

Most existing systems are special-purpose, with a majority aiming at educational applications. Previous developments on the AHA system (De Bra & Calvi, 1998) and the AHAM model (De Bra et al, 1999) have shown that general-purpose AHS can be designed and implemented, but also that such systems tend to be too complicated for non-technical authors. This paper describes the “third generation AHA”, called Adaptive Hypermedia for All, which is being developed as an open source project sponsored by the NLnet Foundation. AHA aims at bringing adaptivity to all kinds of Web-based applications, through a simple but powerful adaptive engine. In this paper we focus on the authoring interface for creating the conceptual structure of an adaptive application.

abstract = {The earliest computer-aided hypertext systems were built in the 1960s, and (unlike some of the most popular later systems) fully integrated it with their hypertext functionality. Brown University’s FRESS was the first hypertext system to run on commercial hardware and OS. It actually handled complex documents better than non-hypertext systems, and so was used as a publishing system as well as a collaborative hypertext environment for teaching, research, and development. FRESS had considerable support for document structuring and markup, affording separation of structure from formatting and hypertext semantics. It also provided a variety of coordinated views and a very powerful conditional-structure and view-specification mechanisms that suited it for many tasks still considered hard today: dynamic document assembly, structured information retrieval, and on-the-fly customization of even very large documents for the user, display device, and context. This paper gives an overview of FRESS’s design approach especially with regard to its treatment of markup and structure; it discusses some ways that document structures differ from other familiar information structures; and argues that a sophisticated model of document structure is necessary to realize fully the potential of hypertext.}, 
notes = {ISSN: 1099-6621

FRESS’s first major use in education was in teaching the NEH-sponsored English poetry course where students did all of their critical course reading and writing in the online FRESS docuverse, already called a web at that time in emulation of Bush’s use of that term ([Catano, “Poetry”]).

FRESS introduced the revert command, that let users undo any editing action. We know of no earlier system with undo, and this innovation radically changed the way in which students and other users interacted with the system.

And by “complex situations” we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years.

With the Web launching as a mass distribution platform, EQRH faced a fast-evolving technological landscape, paired with an emergent gift and open access economy. Its non-linear writing experiments afford key insights into historical, medium-specific authoring practices. Access constraints have left EQRH under-researched and threatened by obsolescence. To address this challenge, this study offers platform-specific analyses of all the EQRH’s cross-media materials, including works that have hitherto escaped scholarly attention. It deploys a form of conceptually oral ethno-historiography: the lore of electronic literature.

This paper examines Twine from a platform studies perspective to understand how it supports and facilitates more experimental works. The platform’s development history, documentation, UI, method of content generation, and distribution model combine to create a tool that facilitates these kinds of works. Twine’s reference materials (oriented not toward code and problem solving, but to affirmation of the individual experience as the basis of a game), user interface (analogous to common brainstorming/writing techniques), orientation toward vignette (with the genre’s subversive potential) and open distribution model (free to download, free to share, and exported as HTML) make the platform a uniquely-accessible tool for creating highly personal games. Analyzing Twine in this way allows game researchers to understand the importance of Twine’s design to the creation of such works, in turn illustrating factors that platform developers may use to guide future software.},

abstract = {iMapping is a visual technique for structuring information objects. It is based on research in the fields of visual mapping techniques, Information Visualisation and cognitive psychology. iMapping uses a Zooming User Interface to facilitate navigation and to help users maintain an overview in the knowledge space. An iMap is comparable to a large whiteboard where wiki-pages can be positioned like post-its but also nested into each other. Augmenting Wikis by providing spatial browsing and zooming facilities makes it easier to structure content in an intuitive way. Especially semantic wikis, which typically contain more fine-grained content, and stress the structure between information items, can benefit from a graphical approach like iMapping, that allows to dis- play multiple such items and multiple wiki-pages in one view. This paper describes the iMapping approach in general, and briefly how it will be applied as a rich client front-end to the SemWiki engine.},

abstract = {Locative narrative systems have been a popular area of research for nearly two decades, but they are often bespoke systems, developed for particular deployments, or to demonstrate novel technologies. This has meant that they are short-lived, the narratives have been constructed by the creators of the system, and that the barrier to creating locative experiences has remained high due to a lack of common tools. We set out to create a platform based on the commonalities of these historic systems, with a focus on hypertext structure, and designed to enable locative based narratives to be created, deployed, and experienced in-the-wild. The result is StoryPlaces, an open source locative hypertext platform and authoring tool designed around a sculptural hypertext engine and built with existing Web technologies. As well as providing an open platform for future development, StoryPlaces also offers novelty in its management of location, including the separation of location and nodes, of descriptions from locations, and of content from pages, as well as being designed to have run-time caching and disconnection resilience. It also advances the state of the art in sculptural hypertext systems delivery through conditional functions, and nested, geographic and temporal conditions. The StoryPlaces platform has been used for the public deployment of over twenty locative narratives, and demonstrates the effectiveness of a general platform for delivering complex locative narrative experiences. In this paper we describe the process of creating the platform and our insights on the design of locative hypertext platforms.},

abstract = {This paper addresses combining hypertext with knowledge representation as used in knowledge-based systems. Hypertext imposes explicit structure on text, whereas certain knowledge representation formalisms of Al are designed for structuring knowledge. We propose a way of tightly integrating hypertext and structured object representation, using (AI) frames for the basic representation of hypertext nodes. Moreover, we allow for the additional option of explicit representation of structure using partitions of hypertext nodes, which are realized as slots. In order to make the text more dynamic, our approach facilitates some aspects of object-oriented programming using message passing from the text in the browser.

The proposed tight integration is useful for design tasks, in particular for building knowledge-based systems. According to our experience, hypertext provides a useful intermediary representation of knowledge between informal and formal. Based on a level of basic hypertext functionality, we provide several features useful for supporting knowledge acquisition. As an example of our results of using this method of knowledge acquisition, we illustrate the strategic knowledge in our application domain. In addition, tight integration supports important aspects of software engineering and the user interface. Moreover, we discuss several advantages from a hypertext point of view. In particular, the partitions of hypertext nodes can be useful for selective inheritance of text. In summary, both Al and hypertext will benefit from such a tight integration.},

abstract = {The AM program, an early attempt to mechanize learning by discovery, has recently been expanded and extended to several other task domains. AM’s ultimate failure apparently was due to its inability to discover new, powerful, domain-specific heuristics for the various new fields it uncovered. At that time, it seemed straight-forward to simply add ‘Heuristics’ as one more field in which to let AM explore, observe, define, and develop. That task—learning new heuristics by discovery—turned out to be much more difficult than was realized initially, and we have just now achieved some successes at it. Along the way, it became clearer why AM had succeeded in the first place, and why it was so difficult to use the same paradigm to discover new heuristics. In essence, AM was an automatic programming system, whose primitive actions were modifications to pieces of LISP code, code which represented the characteristic functions of various math concepts. It was only because of the deep relationship between LISP and Mathematics that these operations (loop unwinding, recursion elimination, composition, argument elimination, function substitution, etc.) which were basic LISP mutators also turned out to yield a high ‘hit rat’ of viable, useful new math concepts when applied to previously-known, useful math concepts. But no such deep relationship existed between LISP and Heuristics, and when the basic automatic programming operators were applied to viable, useful heuristics, they almost always produced useless (often worse than useless) new rules. Our work on the nature of heuristics has enabled the construction of a new language in which the statement of heuristics is more natural and compact. Briefly, the vocabulary includes many types of conditions, actions, and descriptive properties that a heuristic might possess; instead of writing a large lump of LISP code to represent the heuristic, one spreads the same information out across dozens of ‘slots’. By employing this new language, the old property that AM satisfied fortuitously is once again satisfied: the primitive syntactic operators usually now produce meaningful semantic variants of what they operate on. The ties to the foundations of Heuretics have been engineered into the syntax and vocabulary of the new language, partly by design and partly by evolution, much as John McCarthy engineered ties to the foundations of Mathematics into LISP. The EURISKO program embodies this language, and it is described in this paper, along with its results in eight task domains: design of naval fleets, elementary set theory and number theory, LISP programming, biological evolution, games in general, the design of three-dimensional VLSI devices, the discovery of heuristics which help the system discover heuristics, and the discovery of appropriate new types of ‘slots’ in each domain. Along the way, some very powerful new concepts, designs, and heuristics were indeed discovered mechanically. Characteristics that make a domain ripe for AM-like exploration for new concepts and conjectures are explicated, plus features that make a domain especially suitable for EURISKO-level exploration for new heuristics.},

This book is all you need to get up and running with this exciting (and free) way to build and manage content.

This text is first and foremost a guide to what Wiki software is and how to install, customize, and administer it within your organization. Early sections discuss the advantages of Wiki Web sites, which allow all users to add and edit content. While it might sound like a free-for-all, the authors suggest such Web sites have been used successfully in research, business, and education to document project designs, for brainstorming, and for otherwise creating content in a collaborative fashion. Case studies for such organizations as Georgia Tech, New York Times Digital, and Motorola give a glimpse of Wiki used in real settings, so you will get a sense of what to expect.

This book is also a guide to the nuts and bolts of downloading and installing Wiki and customizing it for your site. Sections on basic tweaks to Wiki’s Perl scripts will let you customize your site to match your organization’s needs. Standout material includes almost three dozen customization tips. This volume is illustrated with actual screen shots of Wiki, so you can get a sense of what it is like for users to work together in such an unrestricted fashion.

Throughout the text, the authors are suitably upbeat about Wiki’s prospects for wider adoption, but they are realistic enough to note compromises (such as requiring passwords and restricting edit rights) required in business settings. They also survey the field of Wiki open-source projects and clones, as well as other similar content-management solutions (such as Zope and the emerging WebDAV standard).

While it’s hard to predict whether Wiki-based Web sites are for everyone, this book presents the pros and cons of a potentially exciting and useful tool that promotes collaborative content creation. This title can help any organization get going with a Wiki Web site, from the standpoint of planning, deployment, and basic administration. Richard Dragan

To explore the characteristics of information triage and its interaction with spatial hypertext, a medium we claim supports the process, we have studied subjects engaged in a time-constrained decision-making task using a large set of relevant documents. We use the study task to investigate information triage under three different conditions: one in which the participants used paper documents, and two others in which the participants used variants of VIKI, a spatial hypertext system. Our findings suggest that during information triage attentional resources are devoted to evaluating materials and organizing them, so they can be read and reread as they return to mind. Accordingly, hypertext tools to support the practice should facilitate the rapid assimilation and assessment of new material, aid in the creation and management of a fluid category structure, allow readers to track their own progress through the information, and use minimum-effort methods to promote the intelligibility of results.},

abstract = {It has been shown that the famous problem of user disorientation in hypertext is not due to the concept of hypertext itself but rather generally results from the lack of a conceptual model for hypertext application. Unfortunately, in most hypertext systems, the weakness of structure specification mechanisms discourages the development and use of such a model since it is difficult to reinforce hypertext structure and to really incorporate knowledge. A lot of works provide intelligent mechanisms to help navigation but either they use external knowledge or automatically synthesize links from information included in nodes which thereby have no sufficient conceptual value.
The present paper focuses on an object-oriented hypertext model (implemented in the MacWeb system) using structured types to incorporate knowledge in hypertext. Concepts and their relationships as well as their instances and their own relationships may be represented. Such a model makes the capture of knowledge at source easier thus allowing
a more conceptual navigation, Furthermore, active behaviors may be associated, as methods, to types. This provides a powerful mechanism to help develop structured hypertext as well as task centered applications, by taking advantage of knowledge representation.},

Well, by “hypertext” I mean non-sequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at an interactive screen.

0/5-0/6 ‘Xanalogical storage. Col 2, para 2 - Col1 para 2.
The Xanadu system is a unique form of storage for text and other computer data. The system is based upon one pool of storage, which can be shared and simultaneously organized in many different ways. This makes it possible easily to make new things out of old, sharing material between units. Described simply:

 - all materials are in a shared pool of units, but every element has a unit in which it originated;

 - new units can be built from material in previous units, in addition to new material;

- there can be arbitrary links between arbitrary sections of units.

We call this “xanalogical storage” (not a trademark).

1/25 Visible Links, illustration bottom right. 
It seems to me that a crucial aspect was being able to compare alternative possibilities easily: so the user writing a screen could make detailed inter-comparisons

2/24 visible links

2/26. Jump links. Body text.
This simple facility—the jump-link capability—leads immediately to all sorts of new text forms: for scholarship, for teaching, for fiction, for hyper-poetry. This makes possible a certain free-form serendipitous browsing.

2/35 The ‘Windows Sandwich’. (diagram)

2/37. Links & Time. Col 1, para 2 & footnote.
Note also, however, that a quotation—an inclusion window—may be fixed to another document in two ways: at a certain point in time, in which case revisions are seen by the user only when he or she asks, “What has this passage become?” Or second, at a relatively fixed location in the document space, in which case updates are seen automatically1.

1. There are therefore two types of inclusion links: floating in time and fixed in time. But distinguishing among them—for instance, suggesting the most recent version to the readerÈis a front-end function.

2/38-39 Document ownership, versioning by descent, versioning by inclusion, nested inclusion.

2/53 Docuverse:
All of storage near and far must therefore become a united whole— what is now called a “distributed data base.” Actual locations become essentially invisible to the user; or, in that traditional phrase, “You don’t care where it’s stored.” The documents and their links unite into what is essentially a swirling complex of equi-accessible unity, a single great universal text and data grid, or, as we call it, the docuverse.

3/9 The Framing Problem (diagram)

3/17 The Hypercorps
The Xanadu Hypercorps is expected to be an unusual and elite group. They will circulate amongst Xanadu stations transmitting skills and outlook. They will not be people who can program or repair a computer; rather, like the stewards and stewardesses of the airlines, they will know how to make the users comfortable. Also how to help them be productive and enjoy themselves within their intended budget. Like good librarians the Hypercorps will have an understanding of what materials are available, but they will know how to deal with an avalanche, rather than a trickle, of ideas and information. Like a good teachers they will have a sense of how to convey ideas. Like good woodsman they will have a sense of the trails and byways of the territory to be explored. And like academics they will have a personal love for one or more topics that they will watch and study in their free time on the system.

abstract = {The historical development of hypermedia systems can be characterized as a series of successive abstractions of functionality away from the “core” hypermedia server, often resulting in a new open layer in the hypermedia environment architecture. Recently, this trend of abstraction has been applied to the hypermedia server itself, replacing the notion of a single, closed hypermedia server with an open layer of structure servers. This newest development brings with it a new set of challenges and research issues for open hypermedia researchers. In this paper, we discuss these issues, review some of our collective applicable experience with contemporary open hypermedia systems and other work, and point out some of the more pressing and intriguing open questions that we feel are facing open hypermedia researchers today. We also examine the “split” in the current hypermedia research community between “system” and “domain” researchers and the still-present need for interoperability among systems, and discuss why any attempt to address the issues we discuss in this paper must account for these observations.},

Users express categories and interrelationships through the visual similarity and co-location of information objects. The ease of changing a visual property or moving an object makes spatial hypertext better suited to tasks where the information continually evolves. But the implicit nature of the structure poses challenges for tasks in which the authors and readers are not the same set of people. The Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB) includes the ease of expression of earlier spatial hypertexts while adding greater support for long-term collaboration and tasks requiring explicit links. VKB includes a history mechanism that records the evolution of the spatial hypertext and local, global, and historical links for explicit navigational connections between chunks of information. The mechanisms added to VKB make spatial hypertext applicable in a much wider variety of tasks. In particular, VKB’s global links enable wide-area distributed spatial hypertext using the existing infrastructure of the Internet. Versions of VKB have been in use for two years in tasks including note taking, writing, project management, and conference organization.},

The authors propose computa- tional approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose non- computational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users – a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design.},

abstract = {Printed books were an enormous stimulus to science, culture, commerce, and entertainment. Electronic books and hypertext systems may produce a similar stimulus in the next century, but current designs are poor. Typical screens are too small, too slow, too complicated, and too hard to read. With careful attention to the user interface and the underlying technology, we have a chance to create a new medium that is potentially more attractive and effective than printed books in many situations.

Electronic books can have color, animation, sound, rapid access, compactness, rapid traversal and search, user annotation, electronic dissemination and updating, dynamic text to reflect the user’s needs, and other features yet undreamed of.},

The Trellis model not only represents the relationships that tie individual pieces of information together into a document (i.e., the adjacencies), but specifies the browsing semantics to be associated with the hypertext as well (i.e., the manner in which the information is to be visited and presented). The model is based on Petri nets, and is a generalization of existing directed graph-based forms of hypertext. The Petri net basis permits more powerful specification of what is to be displayed when a hypertext is browsed and permits application of previously developed Petri net analysis techniques to verify properties of the hypertext. A number of useful hypertext constructs, easily described in the Trellis model, are presented. These include the synchronization of simultaneous traversals of separate paths through a hypertext, the incorporation of access controls into a hypertext (i.e., specifying nodes that can be proven to be accessible only to certain classes of browsers), and construction of multiple specialized (tailored) versions from a single hypertext.},

This is done by reporting about the design, development, and implementation of SEPIA and presenting results on dedicated and comprehensive authoring functionality addressing also the new rhetoric of hypermedia, a hypermedia data model with composites, persistent and shared data storage for hypermedia, and support for cooperative work, esp. cooperative writing. We start by identifying the challenge of hypermedia authoring and production which serves as the driving force for our development. Using interacting problem spaces as the vehicle for modelling the dynamic aspects of authoring, we arrive at a set of requirements answered by the concept of “activity spaces”. The design of coherent hyper-documents is facilitated by a “construction kit”. Furthermore, we describe the extensions and modifications necessary to support multiple authors with the cooperative version of SEPIA. Based on the requirements, we develop a system architecture and report on the implementation of the system. We describe the basis for access to shared hyperdocuments, the activity space browsers, the integration of multimedia functionality (audio, graphics, pictures), and the integration of an audio and video conferencing system. Finally, we report on more recent developments and future work.},

This is accomplished by joining the nodes with typed links. In this chapter, we outline a proposed taxonomy of primitive link types.
We should first note that there is an alternative to such a fixed set of link types. One can imagine a facility whereby users are allowed to define new link types. Though this does provide for extensibility, it seems unlikely that scientific writing is evolving at such a rate that new link types are regularly discovered. Rather, we feel that the set of link types is fairly static. For this reason and the following practical considerations, we decided not to provide such a facility.},

abstract = {Hypermedia is often described as nodes of information with links between them, suggesting the conceptual model of a graph. A broader definition is a system of nodes of information through which people can move nonlinearly. Such a definition, while including graph-based hypermedia, also allows alternative implementations. This paper illustrates the need for alternative models by exhibiting a particular reasoning task for which navigating among nodes by way of explicit links is less effective than an alternative model of intersecting sets of nodes. The task is taxonomic reasoning, a particular kind of reasoning task that deals with the comparison and classification of highly similar nodes, in which an analyst viewing one node thinks not in terms of linking it to another node, but of including it in or excluding it from a set of related nodes.

This paper discusses this kind of reasoning and describes HyperSet, a set-based hypermedia system designed to support it. It compares HyperSet with other tools that support taxonomic reasoning, discusses the formal and implementational relationships between graph-based and set-based hypermedia, and defines the features that are required in a hybrid system that can concurrently support both set and graph manipulations.},
