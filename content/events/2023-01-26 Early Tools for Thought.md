* It comes in 2 parts.
* The RTF is an index, listing the slide number, and then the references for the item(s) on that slide.
* Each reference also has a citekey for an item in the second file a plain text file (.bib) of BibTeX format data.
* Most decent Reference Managers can ingest BibTeX and for those without an RM the file is still readable in a text editor (I quite appreciate BibTeX isn't common in general public use). However, print-format references omit so much data I think they are unhelpful to the general reader.
